## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test driven development is a software development process where **you write
tests before writing the software code.** Once the test have been written, you
the write the code to sure the tests pass.

1. Create tests that verify the functionality of a specific feature.
2. Write software code that will run the tests successfully when re-executed.
3. Refactor the code for optimization while ensuring the tests continue pass.

TDD also called red-green testing as all tests go from a red failed state to 
a green passed state.
