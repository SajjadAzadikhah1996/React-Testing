## Browser extension

Do you still have problems knowing how to use Testing Library queries?

There is a very cool Browser extension for Chrome
named [Testing Playground](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano),
and it helps you find the best queries to
select elements. It allows you to inspect the element hierarchies in the Browser's Developer Tools, and provides you
with suggestions on how to select them, while encouraging good testing practices.

## Playground

If you want to get more familiar with these queries, you can try them out
on [testing-playground.com](https://testing-playground.com/). Testing Playground
is an interactive sandbox where you can run different queries against your own html, and get visual feedback matching
the rules mentioned above.
